    description: |-
      In computer science, algorithmics is used in various applications, particularly in the field of artificial intelligence, which is notable for the use of machine learning techniques. This section aims to implement principles of ecodesign and frugality in the training and inference of algorithmic models used for artificial intelligence. The training (or learning) phase refers to the process by which a system performs calculations, using data and algorithmic models, to provide functionalities. This is followed by an inference phase, implementing the trained models.
criteres:
  - id: "1.1"
    critere: "Has the digital service been assessed favourably in terms of utility, taking its impact on the environment into account?"
    thematique: "Strategy"
    objectif: "Take the digital service's utility into account from the design stage, and seek to satisfy at least one of the sustainable design goals (SDG), one of the planetary boundary issues and/or the targets of any other similar policy framework."
    miseEnOeuvre: |-
      To assess the service's utility, refer to other standards and policies and determine up front if the project is useful, and particularly:
      - The UN's 17 sustainable development goals (SDG)
      - The 9 planetary boundaries
      - The European framework to facilitate sustainable investment
      - The CSRD Directive – Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive
      - ISO standards, particularly ISO 26 000 (non-certifiable)
      - Global Reporting Initiative

      If the service's utility is not part of these policy frameworks, establishing why the service is useful contributes to the general interest or supports a public policy. This analysis must factor in the benefit analysis of the digital solution compared to an alternative solution and the rebound effects, if applicable.

      Verify one or several of the following, for instance: its relevance, its utility, its value creation, its validity, contribution to the public interest, how it satisfies essential needs, contribution to the creation of digital commons, etc.

      Applicable to all services
    controle: |-
      Detail how the service was assessed, e.g. which sustainable development goals are attached to the service, how planetary boundary issues are addressed, which other policy frameworks are used (specify), and how they are relevant in the digital service's Ecodesign declaration of conformity.

      A digital service validates this criterion if it is the subject of a study whose purpose is to assess and substantiate the environmental and social impacts.

      The report will contain at least one answer to the following questions:
      - Is a digital technology required to provide this service?
      - Is there any non-digital solutions that could satisfy this need?
      - What are the real needs that justify the creation of this service?
      - Does the service's value added justify the use of resources needed to create it? Is more value being created than destroyed?
      - For each feature: Is this capability really necessary? Can it be done differently?
      - What would happen if it did not exist?

      This study must also include a qualitative analysis of the potential direct and indirect environmental impacts tied to the service, which will mean producing an issue tree according to the ADEME Level 1 Project footprint method.

    thematique: "Strategy"
    objectif: |-
      To satisfy the needs of the digital service's users as fully as possible, having knowledge of one's targets, their usage patterns, needs and behaviours is crucial, to avoid overloading digital services with features and content, or stripping them down to the point of failing to meet expectations. If primary and secondary user categories are not identified, it is hard to design the digital service properly.
    
      Uncertainties often lead to extrapolating needs beyond actual expectations. One might also fail to meet 'right needs' due to a lack of knowledge of one's users, or only doing what the project owner requested. All of this ends up being a waste of resources, of time and has a negative impact on the environment. All non-essential features must be avoided. In addition, it is important to check that one or several other services do not already satisfy this need, to avoid duplicating them."
    miseEnOeuvre: |-
      To define target users, mobilise the tools and components of the UX Research phase: competition analysis, analysis of existing products, define user personas, conduct user interviews or surveys, observation, etc.

      These could be the stages used to identify target users' job-related needs:
      - interviews with the different stakeholders and occupations affected;
      - UX research with target users;
      - define primary and secondary users;
      - adjunct practice: agile methodologies;
      - observation of usage statistics in the case of an existing service.
    controle: |-
      Give access to these research stage reference documents: user interviews, UX research, benchmarks, user personas, marketing studies, etc. that make it possible to obtain a detailed definition of target users. Based on these elements, research, observations, surveys, etc. should also be accessible to be able to obtain an accurate expression of job-related needs and target users' other actual expectations.

      To validate this criterion, the target user profile that analyses users' job-related needs and expectations should be clearly detailed in the digital service's Ecodesign declaration of conformity, along with the choices made in this area.

    objectif: "The ecodesign of sustainable digital services covers a very large scope that is hard to tackle fully during each stage of the project. It is vital that the team members working on the project be able to rely at all times one or several resource people to assist them in the best practices to deploy. The function of the ecodesign supervisor is important for guaranteeing consistency between the implementation of ecodesign measures, their monitoring and their sustainability."
    miseEnOeuvre: |-
      The internal or external supervisor(s) ensure the project team's acculturation to digital service ecodesign, to encourage its assimilation into all projects.

      The ecodesign supervisor will maintain internal technical documentation, so that the ecodesign techniques are written down and shared with the team in charge of the digital service, to ensure their future sustainability.

      They will also be responsible for implementing a periodic review, taking stock of the service's ecodesign strategy, and for updating the Ecodesign declaration of conformity.

      They verify that the teams involved in designing the digital service are aware of (and possibly trained in) ecodesign.

    objectif: |-
      Depending on the context, a digital service can evolve: the team changes, users add content, increasingly resource-hungry processing, etc. To ensure that this ecodesign approach is sustained over time, reviews need to be performed on a regular basis. 
      
      The publication of an Ecodesign declaration of conformity also leads to greater transparency on digital service' environmental performance for users and stakeholders.

Moreover, performing performance audits and load tests on the application/component/micro-service, identifying bottlenecks, resources used, etc. The frequency of these procedures should be tailored to the size and nature of the digital service.

      Providing an account of this (self) assessment in the Ecodesign declaration of conformity, which must be updated regularly, at least when any significant change is made to the service. The Ecodesign declaration of conformity should also list the actions planned to improve the service's environmental performance.

    thematique: "Strategy"
    objectif: "Measuring and reducing the digital service's environmental footprint. This implies having a global understanding of the digital service's impact, at each stage (beginning, operation, end), and incorporating the environmental impacts of the equipment used in the product and use of this digital service."
    miseEnOeuvre: |-
      Define environmental indicators to be tracked, if possible following a diagnosis based on a multicriteria life cycle assessment analysis (LCA) methodology, to identify those indicators that create the ability to document the majority of the service's or the organisation's environmental footprint (see the European Commission's "Product Environmental Footprint" and "Organisation Environmental Footprint" methodologies and ISO 14040 and ISO 14044 standards).

      The environmental impact indicators to be considered as top priority – according to available data – are:
      - Primary energy consumption
      - GHG emissions
      - Blue Water footprint (i.e. direct consumption of surface and groundwater)
      - Abiotic resource (at least metals and minerals) depletion

      The scope of the LCA can be expanded, for instance to include production methods: environmental impact of design equipment, online services used (test and QA environments…), team members' travel, etc.

      Set (short, medium and long-term) reduction targets for the digital service's environmental footprint based on the projected number of users. The top priority monitored indicators must pertain to primary energy consumption, GHG emissions, Blue Water footprint and abiotic resource depletion. Depending on the context, it should be stipulated whether the indicators are in absolute (kg CO2e) or relative (kg CO2e/user) value.
    controle: |-
      Environmental indicators have been identified to obtain information on the digital service's environmental footprint. If data availability permits, these environmental indicators should be based on the LCA methodology.

      Pay particular attention to the following questions when reviewing the document:
      - What indicators have been defined? At the very least, the top priority indicators listed in the implementation section must be included.
      - How will these indicators be monitored?
      - Will they be published/openly available and, if yes, where?
      - Is the methodology for assessing the monitored indicators publicly accessible?

      At what regularity will the assessment be performed? Moreover, environmental footprint reduction targets are set for the service for the monitored environmental indicators. They will concern, at least, primary energy consumption, GHG emissions, Blue Water footprint and abiotic (metal/mineral) resource depletion.

      These targets can be part of the trajectory set at the system or organisational level. For some environmental issues such as climate change, trajectories must be aligned with the Paris Agreement (e.g. based on SBTi standards, or Recommendation ITU-T L.1470 for ICT).

      The criterion is validated if the service's environmental footprint has been assessed – using a recognised methodology, if possible a (multicriteria) LCA assessing the service's impacts across its life cycle – and if the service has impact reduction targets. These elements must be monitored regularly and be recorded in a public and auditable document, e.g. the service's Ecodesign declaration of conformity.

    thematique: "Strategy"
    objectif: "Encourage responsible and judicious data collection to complement the legal obligation to comply with the principle of 'data minimisation' set forth in the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) with respect to personal data. The aim is to work on decreasing the amount of data that are collected, processed and stored by the service, including non-personal data and metadata, to optimise the use of IT resources."
    miseEnOeuvre: |-
      Clearly define the data needed for the service to operate, consistent with target users and their expectations as defined in criterion 1.2 of this policy framework.

      If a datum does not contribute directly to improving the user experience or the service's operation, consider not collecting it.

      The collection of metadata for the purpose of user profiling should be avoided.

      For each type of data deemed essential to the service's operation and to users' needs, define collection terms and conditions that comply explicitly with GDPR provisions regarding personal data.

      For non-personal data, their conservation period must also be minimised to reduce excessive data storage.

      Implement complete information, the right to refuse and/or the need to obtain explicit consent to use all of the collected data, including non-personal data.
    controle: |-
      Monitor the type and quantity of data that are collected, processed and stored by the service.

      Regarding personal data, independent of ecodesign issues, the minimisation of this data collection is a GDPR imperative and must be strictly monitored by the data controller.

      From a broader perspective, for all of the collected data (including non-personal), substantiate the need for this collection in the service’s Ecodesign declaration of conformity with respect to its target users (criterion 1.2), limiting their processing and period of conservation, and document the tools used to obtain consent, if applicable. As concerns personal data, a referral could be made back to the records of processing activities on personal data stipulated in the GDPR. 
      
      Do not collect metadata used to profile users, unless this collection process is vital to meeting the needs of the service’s end users (criterion 1.2) or its operation, and provided the user has given their express and informed consent, and can disable this collection at any time. If applicable, these elements must be documented in the digital service’s Ecodesign declaration of conformity.

    critere: "Does the digital service use an encryption level tailored to its needs?"
    thematique: "Strategy"
    objectif: |-
      In most situations, the use of cryptographic mechanisms is absolutely essential for protecting IT systems, as well as the – notably personal – data that are collected and processed. These mechanisms have an environmental footprint to consider. For instance, encryption automatically increases power consumption, first by the computing needed to execute both the encryption and subsequent decryption, but also by the storage and load on the communication networks. In some cases, they can nevertheless help lighten the load on IT systems (by compressing archives parallel to encryption, or by avoiding having to keep or circulate certain files). This practice therefore aims to promote the minimisation of encryption’s environmental cost, while factoring in the required security constraints. Encryption also increases data protection and security, and reduces the risk of security breaches and data leaks, whose subsequent handling have an energy footprint
    miseEnOeuvre: |-
      For a given security level, find the optimum choices for preserving resources:
      - Perform comparative measures of different encryption algorithms to select the one that introduces the smallest amount of processor resources for an equivalent performance
      - Assess the need for encryption considering the nature of the data and associated risks
      - When encryption is planned, implement an algorithm and implementation process that minimise the service's environmental footprint (without compromising the required level of security)

      Use encryption mechanisms that provide the ability to generate proof without having to keep or divulge the file to be proven (e.g. proof of the supply of an ID card, etc.).

      Keep the encrypted and compressed archives (free tools such as 7zip and Zed! operate on this principle).
    controle: |-
      If the service relies on encryption mechanisms, document the reasons for choosing to implement them in terms of the service’s IT security risks and the minimisation of the associated environmental footprint, in the service’s Ecodesign declaration of conformity.

    thematique: "Strategy"
    objectif: |-
      Open source means that the code can be used for other projects, thereby avoiding a waste of dedicated resources. The publication of a digital service’s source code in open source also helps extend the service’s lifespan by relying on collaboration with the community of developers and researchers to fix any bugs and add new features. It also makes it easier to audit and be more transparent, including from an environmental standpoint. 
      
      Open source is also a way to extend the life of the hardware associated with using a digital service. 
      
      For instance, open source applications or pilot projects associated with a connected object (smart speaker, smart watch, etc.) or a peripheral (printer, etc.) make it possible to supplement the life of the “proprietary” programs required to run them.
    miseEnOeuvre: |-
      Publishing a digital service's source code as open source (licence-free) for those elements that are not covered by confidentiality obligations, and in accordance with any applicable intellectual property rights.

    controle: |-
      The digital service’s source code is published as open source when it is not subject to confidentiality restrictions or intellectual property rights. If some parts of the digital service’s code are not published as open source, the reasons for that choice need to be substantiated in the digital service’s Ecodesign declaration of conformity, so that it can be audited by a third party. If applicable, the provider must show that it has made an effort to open all or part of its source code. Whenever possible, the digital service should use open source code for its own operation. 
      
      The criterion is validated if the service’s code is published with a royalty-free licence, and if the choices and efforts made in this area are substantiated in the digital service’s Ecodesign declaration of conformity

    critere: "Has the digital service been designed using standard, interoperable technologies rather than dedicated, closed-source technologies?"
    thematique: Strategy
    objectif: |-
      The goal is to combat the equipment’s software-induced obsolescence. Any digital service that strives to be the most stable and sustainable over time will extend the devices’ useful life. Typically, the use of new application programming interfaces (APIs) or new standards not supported by older devices is likely to hasten devices’ obsolescence. As a result, standards interoperability is a crucial means of extending the devices’ useful life and their lifespan. As another example, native applications may need the latest OS (operating system) versions or even the latest versions of equipment to function, which leads to hardware obsolescence.
    miseEnOeuvre: |-
      Well in advance of development, assess feasibility with standard technologies (e.g., web rather than native applications) to meet the needs of users and occupations/team members. It is also a question of ensuring that the APIs used are standard and are well supported (JavaScript APIs in web browsers, for instance). Relying on interoperable technologies creates the ability to combat software obsolescence. Similarly, building your service from open source components enables ongoing control over the maintenance of the code used, thereby improving the code’s longevity and reducing the risk of the hardware’s software-induced obsolescence. 
      
      In the event that a native application is required (e.g., in some cases, if the digital service requires particularly sensitive data processing), ensure that it uses standards that are compatible with the main operating systems.
    controle: |-
      Verify that the digital service can be used by the same interface on all relevant devices (e.g. a Web app). If the digital service is a native application, assess the need to have chosen to develop a native application: technical constraints, control over target hardware? 
      
      The criterion is validated if the service is based on interoperable standards that are common to the main ecosystems (devices, operating systems, browsers, etc.).

    thematique: Strategy
    objectif: |-
      A connected object or device interacts with its environment via APIs (dedicated program access interfaces),
      typically called via a "pilot" or "driver" program, or an application on a smartphone.

      - When these APIs are not open, it is often impossible to extend the object's lifespan beyond that of
        the application or driver originally designed for the object: if this software is abandoned, a perfectly
        functional object or peripheral becomes unusable.
      
      - When the APIs are open (documented and open use), a third-party developer can develop an
        alternative application and extend the life of the object or peripheral.

      For connected objects marketed with an application or driver, the obsolescence of the application or driver
      marks the end of life for the object.

      Open source software makes it possible to compensate for this obsolescence provided the APIs and formats
      are documented and open, the only way for third-party software developers to develop alternatives and
      extend the life of these objects or devices. It also makes it possible to run the connected object or device on
      operating systems that are not supported by the hardware designer.
    miseEnOeuvre: |-
      If the software/driver is associated with a piece of equipment, device or peripheral, the designer must
      provide open and documented APIs (application programming interfaces) to allow alternative digital services
      to be used on the device in the event of a software defect or abandonment, to extend the life of the object
      or device.

      A digital service that uses only the latest generation of technical resources can push users to replace their
      equipment to be able to access it (hardware obsolescence). As a result, some uses may be constrained by
      their devices. To allow for a wider choice of devices, including old ones, and to reduce the need to replace
      them, it is important to profile the hardware that users will be able to employ, both today and in future:
      minimum internet connection speed, screen size, microprocessor speed, number of Gb of RAM, touch screen
      or not, smartphone, tablet, etc. laptop, desktop computer, etc.

    critere: "Can the digital service be used on older model devices?"
    thematique: Specifications
    objectif: |-
      According to the ADEME-Arcep study, devices – and their production in particular – account for 65% to 90%
      of ICT's environmental footprint, depending on the indicator considered. Extending devices' lifespan is
      therefore an essential lever for reducing the environmental impacts of digital technology. The digital service
      must limit its contribution to their obsolescence by running on the oldest possible devices.
    miseEnOeuvre: |-
      Ensure that the digital service is compatible with old equipment for each feature. For instance, this criterion
      can be added in tests or QA (Quality Assurance) audits.

      Clarification of the criterion:
      - This refers to compatibility with hardware and not with an operating system or any other software
        running the digital service (e.g. a browser). It is therefore not a question of making the digital service
        compatible with software or operating systems for which security updates have not been made.
      - The definition of "usable" here: degraded mode accepted but without loss of essential or critical
        functionality or content for the service.
      - If the digital service is a native application: the digital service must be usable on equipment put on
        the market seven or more years ago, using the latest version of the operating system offered by this
        equipment.
      - If the digital service runs on a web browser: the digital service must be usable on devices equipped
        with a microprocessor that was put on the market ten years ago or more.
      - For other digital services, their use must be guaranteed on devices or peripherals put on the market
        seven or more years ago.
      - A longer compatibility period is recommended. In this case, specify the goal, e.g. in the Ecodesign

      To avoid the proliferation of devices used to access different services, it is recommended that digital services
      be adaptive and able to be displayed equally perfectly on a mobile phone's small screen and a PC's large
      screen. It is best to avoid duplicating the digital service with a specific version for each device. It is also
      recommended that the menus be available in touch mode and through a keyboard.

      - Check that the various typical menu components are accessible via any type of interface, including
        touch or not, with or without a mouse.

    controle: |-
      The digital service runs on an architecture that can adapt allocated resources to demand. Several means of

      - Monitoring the evolution of the ratio between allocated and consumed resources: build a
      comparison between allocated and consumed resources over a period of time and correct existing
      shortcomings in terms of adaptation. Resource monitoring tools can also be set up to collect data on
      CPU usage, memory, bandwidth, etc.

      demand and dynamically allocate the resources needed to maintain performance. Real-world
      scalability tests are also useful.
      - Self-tuning mechanisms: These self-tuning mechanisms are triggered automatically based on load

    thematique: Architecture
    objectif: |-
      The choice of protocols underlying the network exchanges associated with the developed digital service
      affects the demand on infrastructures, as well as the digital service's lifespan. Technical developments in
      protocols that are not supported by the digital service can lead to malfunctions in certain modules or their
      features. Taking these obsolescence risks into account to make the best choices in terms of protocol will limit
      the updates/upgrades required, and thus make the digital service more robust and sustainable. The goal is
      therefore to prevent the service's obsolescence induced by the obsolescence of the protocol used, for
      instance:

      - given the shortage of IPv4 addresses and the ubiquity of IPv6 (in the medium term, some internet
      access lines will no longer offer IPv4 connectivity) by guaranteeing its interoperability and
      sustainability;
      - a service available in IPv6 makes it possible to limit the number of platforms needed and the
      associated energy consumption for operators using IPv4-sharing between customers. IPv6 does not
      need to go through the CG-Nat platform which is expensive in terms of both hardware and power
      (See the video presentation "IPv6 Addressing and Transition" from December 2023);
      - browsers are tending to block HTTP and forcing the mandatory use of HTTPS;
      - because older versions of TLS (TLS v1.0 and TLS v1.1) are no longer supported by web browsers;
      - ensure that the choice of protocol aligns with the type of content exchanged.
    miseEnOeuvre: |-
      For instance:

      - Define an IPv6 testing strategy that includes testing on a device where IPv4 connectivity is disabled.
      Goal: to detect code or functions that run solely in IPv4-only, which will be unusable in the medium
      term, with the phasing out of IPv4.
      - In a context where users access the digital service through their browser, HTTPS must be employed
      instead of HTTP (Article 32 of the GDPR requires an appropriate level of security to be implemented
      for personal data transfers).
      - The TLS version used must support the most recent version (at the time of this writing: TLS v1.3). For
      instance, with Apache, the recommended line configuration is "SSL Protocol all -SSLv3 -TLSv1 -
      TLSv1.1", which provides the ability to enable new versions of TLS when they are available and to
      disable TLS versions that are problematic from a security viewpoint.
      - Multiple protocols exist, each with its own set of advantages and disadvantages. It is recommended
      that a comparison be made between the available protocols according to the types of target content
      and features. This assessment should take into account criteria such as data transfer efficiency,
      latency, compatibility with the technologies used, as well as the environmental impact of each
      protocol. E.g.:
        - for video: Multicast, HTTP Live Streaming (HLS), Real-Time Messaging Protocol (RTMP), Web
        Real-Time Communications (WebRTC)...
        - for APIs: REST, SOAP, GraphQL, Protocol Buffers...
    controle: |-
      Check that the digital service's various components are working properly:

      - in IPv6 and do not use any IPv4-only service, and that the service uses DNS names and not hard coded
      IP addresses;
      - in HTTPS and not HTTP;
      - verify that the latest version of TLS (at the time of writing this policy framework: TLS v1.3) is properly
      supported.
      - Assess the adequacy of the protocol used in relation to the content being transferred, taking into
      account its environmental footprint. This can be achieved by performing the following actions:
        - Analyse the protocol's technical characteristics with respect to the service's needs, or even
        conduct test scenarios or performance comparisons.
        - Consider the environmental impact of the protocol used, including the power consumption
        and underlying computing resource use.

      The criterion is validated if the choice of protocol used by the service aligns with the type of content and
      features targeted, while minimising its environmental cost, and is documented, if possible, in the
      Ecodesign declaration of conformity.

      requires continuous maintenance to ensure optimal operation, security, and interoperability. The goal is
      therefore to limit the contribution to obsolescence of service-related equipment by ensuring the availability
      of patch updates throughout their expected lifetime.

      appropriate support infrastructure, technical and financial resources, and long-term maintenance planning
      – consistent with the hardware's estimated lifespan. Dedicated equipment and connected objects (IoT) are
      targeted here, for instance.

    critere: "Does the digital service provide the ability to install patch updates independently of features updates, in a transparent fashion?"
    thematique: Architecture
    objectif: |
      Since Ordinance No. 2021-1247 of 29 September 2021 on the legal guarantee of conformity for goods, digital content and digital services, the Consumer Code sets forth several obligations relating to software updates to guarantee the receipt of the updates necessary for the conformity of the goods throughout the duration of the legal guarantee of conformity (two years or more), or the entire duration of the contract if the supply of the goods is guaranteed for more than two years. 
      
      In addition, several obligations are defined for vendors concerning updates that are not necessary for the conformity of the goods in terms of informing consumers, the right to refuse and to disable and installation of the update by said vendor. 
      
      In line with these provisions, the goal of the practice is thus to curtail any contribution to the user equipment's obsolescence by allowing the user to opt for only the updates necessary to the service's or device's proper functioning, security and compliance. 
      
      This "segregation" can also prevent the addition of "convenience" features that may be unusable on one's device or require additional hardware or computing resources that can lead to rapid device obsolescence. 
      
      This criterion also aims to promote long-term support policies and enable the digital service to run on older generation operating systems. It will also increase the transparency of information on the type of updates installed and prevent the risk of bloatware.
    miseEnOeuvre: |
      This criterion is particularly relevant for a digital service such as an API/ components /library /framework / open source tools and, far more rarely, a product intended for end users. 
      
      The ability to install patch updates in a segregated manner, as well as any other updates essential to the digital service or user device's compliance and security, features updates that are not necessary for the good's/product's/compliance. 
      
      In addition, the frequency of unnecessary features updates must be monitored. If the nature of the service permits, the possibility of installing patches should be allowed independently of features updates, at the user's request. 
      
      In general, features updates should not prevent the digital service from operating during the entire maintenance period for the supported operating systems (provided there are no technical or security constraints). 
      
      There must be guaranteed transparency on the changes made, by keeping a changelog. In addition, an optimal version control strategy should be encouraged, e.g. with the proposal of "Long term support" releases.
    controle: |
      To validate this criterion:
      - Indicate in an application's update description (changelog) when it is a security or maintenance update ("hotfixes") or if it is a rolling update that adds functionality.
      - Ensure that features updates that are not critical to service compliance do not prevent the service from operating for any maintenance period for supported operating systems.
      - Whenever possible, ensure that updates that are essential to the digital service or user device's compliance and security can be installed separately from features updates that are not necessary for the product's compliance.
      - If possible, check for the presence of a release management strategy with "Long term support" releases.

    objectif: |
      The more time a user spends on a site or application, the higher the environmental footprint associated with that use, as network and system resources on the device will be mobilised for a longer period of time. 
      
      While it is of course up to the user to decide how much time they wish to devote to a particular use, the concerned site or application's development practices may have a direct impact on this duration, in particular through the use of attention-grabbing practices.
      
      Auto playing content, especially videos, is part of the mechanisms put in place to keep the user captive. 
      
      Triggering content and pre-loading it without the user's consent must be avoided with a view to promoting sustainability.
      
      This criterion gives the user the power to limit the use of unnecessary resources.
    miseEnOeuvre: |
      Disable automatic loading and playback of video and/or audio content by default in the service settings. 
      
      If this is not possible, allow the user to remove these features with a button or interface that is directly accessible and visible on the user interface.
      
      As much as possible, do not use animated graphics that the user cannot control or only partially control (animated gifs in particular). 
      
      In particular, auto-playing video and/or audio backgrounds should be avoided if they are purely aesthetic.
      
      For animations deemed essential to the service's functionality, offer the user the ability to pause these elements. 
      
      When the visual animation lasts more than four seconds or a sound lasts more than two seconds, systematically equip the multimedia object with the necessary means of control: start, stop, mute or volume.
      
      Allow them to be simply disabled as soon as the content exceeds four seconds and minimise its size (see criteria 5.3, 5.4. and 5.5).
    controle: |
      The digital service must not include content autoplay by default or, if this is not possible, must provide the user with the ability to easily remove the automatic loading or playback of videos or audio content. 
      
      Deletion options must be highlighted in the digital service (e.g. with a clearly visible "disable" button).
      
      It will also be necessary to limit the number of non-controllable visual animations to what is strictly necessary, and to set quantitative thresholds. 
      
      Non-controllable animations deemed essential to the service's features must be able to be paused by the user as soon as they exceed four seconds for visual animation and two seconds for audio.
      
      The criterion is validated if the service does not rely on a default and uncontrolled autoplay feature, limits the use of uncontrollable visual animations, flashing or auto-scrolling, according to the abovementioned conditions.

      Functional components are, for instance, interface components (menu, button, form, etc.). 
      Typically, a system's native components require few resources to function, unlike components developed on top of it.
      As a result, it may be preferable to encourage the use of components native to a system rather than the use of components developed or overlayed on top of them.

      Downloading fonts can burden a digital service and the IT resources needed to run it. Minimising the number of fonts downloaded makes the digital service load faster, potentially decreases data transfers to third parties, and reduces the service's environmental footprint. The goal is therefore to limit the number of fonts used and to prefer, when possible, natively available fonts, to avoid having to download a specific font separately. Reduce the size of uploaded fonts.

    thematique: User experience and user interface (UX/UI)
    objectif: |-
      Part of a digital service's energy footprint is linked to the volume of data exchanged on networks. The goal is therefore to reduce the volume of data for a given service by avoiding unnecessary client/server requests. For instance, in the context of a form, suggesting results, etc. In most cases, this reduction can be done without degrading the user experience.
    miseEnOeuvre: |-
      To reduce client-server exchanges, it is important for digital services to reduce calls to third-party APIs, scripts, libraries and fonts. 
      
      It is advisable to limit online autocomplete. These autocomplete or suggestion mechanisms, which aim to auto-complete or suggest options, require a great many requests to the server. If such a mechanism is put in place because it is substantiated from the user point of view, it is recommended to wait, for instance, to have three characters and 500 ms after each input before launching a network request. Alternatively, it is possible to let the user choose to enable auto-complete if they wish (opt in) using a settings option.
    controle: |-
      To validate the criterion, ensure the service does not offer autocomplete and, in the opposite case, ensure that autocomplete is substantiated from a user point of view, and periodically check that autocomplete waits for at least 500 ms before activating and at least three characters are entered. The user interface provides the option of disabling autocomplete. 
      
      Monitor the number of HTTP requests between client and server and track this number over time. 
      
      Periodically check for identical and redundant queries.

    thematique: User experience and user interface (UX/UI)
    objectif: |
      Limit client-server exchanges by verifying input on the user device side, thereby reducing input errors and incorrect form submissions that would require feedback to the server for correction.
    miseEnOeuvre: |
      The expected input formats should be defined and indicated clearly and explicitly when the user enters their information before submitting the form (e.g. in the form of help texts, examples or restricted default formats). In the event of an error, the relevant field and the correction to be made should be clearly indicated. 
      
      Validate mandatory data entries and formats when submitting a form without a server request whenever possible. This can be achieved by using validation features built into web programming languages, such as JavaScript. N.B.: Pre-validating data on the frontend does not exempt validation on the backend. Additional server-side validation is therefore still required to ensure data integrity.
    controle: |
      Monitor implementation by testing the service's browsing path or by conducting a design review of the digital service's source code to ensure that the expected format indications are properly listed on the user device. Test the service by filling out the form with incorrect or missing data and verifying that appropriate error messages are displayed to flag input errors.
      
      The criterion is validated if the user is informed of the expected input formats before the form is submitted. The service's mandatory data entries and formats will also need to be validated first on the client side before the form is submitted.

However, the imposed limit must take all uses into account, including those requiring the transfer of large files, as blocking the user's digital process would be counterproductive. It is also important to support new file formats (e.g., WebP and AVIF images in addition to JPEG and PNG images) to avoid forcing the user to go through a counterproductive conversion step. It should be noted that the limitations must be defined in a proportionate manner to avoid having a negative side effect on the service's accessibility, taking target users into account.

    critere: Does the digital service limit the use of notifications, while giving users the ability to disable them?
    thematique: User experience and user interface (UX/UI)
    objectif: |
      Many apps are configured by default to send users notifications to their device. These are incentives to use the service and the associated device (if applicable). The goal is therefore to reduce the use of computing resources by avoiding unnecessary attention-grabbing or IT resource consumption. The goal, then, is to minimise the number of notifications, consider whether to include them by default when designing the digital service and giving the users the ability to disable them.
    miseEnOeuvre: |
      The notifications planned by the digital service serve the needs of the user. Also avoid multiple notifications on different redundant channels (SMS, emails, app notification, interface notification, pop-in, etc.). 
      
      Provide a default configuration that limits notifications. 
      
      The user can turn off notifications or choose how often they are received.
    controle: |
      Monitor the frequency and quantity of notifications, and set quantified targets. 
      
      Document the choices made to reduce notifications to an absolute minimum, so that these choices can be audited in the Ecodesign declaration of conformity. 
      
      The criterion is validated if the digital service: 
      * offers no notifications or a limited number of notifications by default (a target threshold of fewer than five per day); 
      * gives users the ability disable and reduce the service's notifications, via its interface, in a simple and quick way for the user (for instance, a clearly visible button on the UI). The options to disable or reduce the number of notifications must be easily accessible.

    critere: Does the digital service avoid the use of dark patterns in its user interface?
    thematique: User experience and user interface (UX/UI)
    objectif: |
      Prevent the use of dark patterns or manipulative processes in the user interface to ensure that users have control over their digital uses. Dark patterns are design elements that are intentionally designed to deceive or manipulate users to influence user behaviour. Since the entry into force of the Digital Services Act (DSA, Regulation 2022/2065) in 2022, online platform providers' design or operation of online interfaces that are misleading or intended to manipulate the recipient of their service has been prohibited. In line with these legal obligations, the goal of this criterion is to avoid the use of dark patterns in the user interface that are likely to lead to additional online usage, responsible for incremental environmental costs.
    miseEnOeuvre: |
      Prevent the implementation of dark patterns in the design of the user interface. If the service is already in use, review its digital service UI to identify and eliminate the use of dark patterns. Here are some examples of dark pattern practices to avoid: 
      - setting up "labyrinthine" browsing pathways that complicate users' ability to take certain actions (unsubscribing, unregistering) or makes it difficult to access information on legal notices, or the service's environmental footprint for instance; - disguised advertising or exit pop-up ads without user selection or choice; 
      - setting a pre-selected option for the user, often in the form of a pre-checked box, in an effort to entice them to accept something they may not have chosen deliberately; 
      - show a countdown timer for a special offer, but every time the countdown reaches zero, it starts again, creating a false sense of urgency. 
      
      The Designers Ethiques Association's guide can also help identify and correct any misleading elements of the user interface.
    controle: |
      Do not include dark patterns in the service's design and perform a regular assessment of the user interface to detect the presence of manipulative processes. This assessment should take into account the work of the European Commission (including the Guidelines issued pursuant to Article 25 of Regulation 2022/2065). 
      
      The criterion is validated if the UI does not contain manipulative design elements.

    critere: Does the digital service provide users with a means to monitor their usage to be able to track and reduce their associated environmental impacts?
    thematique: User experience and user interface (UX/UI)
    objectif: |
      The goal is to limit the environmental impact by giving users the autonomy to limit their own environmental footprint.
    miseEnOeuvre: |
      The digital service should inform users about the time spent using the service and the environmental impact associated with that use. This information, like any environmental claim, must use recognised norms and standards to quantify and calculate impacts (e.g., the "Product Category Rule", developed for digital services by ADEME). Users should also have the ability, by default or upon request, to choose "sustainable" display and browsing modes that reduce the resources used and the energy consumed. 
      
      With regard to video services and content, it is advisable to refer to Recommendation Article 26 of the Act of 15 November 2021 on reducing the ICT's environmental footprint (REEN Act), published by Arcom, in conjunction with Arcep and ADEME, regarding the information that television services, on-demand audiovisual media services and video-sharing platform services provide to users on the energy consumed and greenhouse gas equivalent emissions generated from the data traffic tied to the use of these services.
    controle: |
      The criterion is validated if the digital service meets the following cumulative conditions: 
      * the service displays information for users on its UI regarding the environmental footprint created by using the service; 
      * the digital service offers a sustainable display and browsing mode, by default or whose activation is left to the user's discretion, to reduce the environmental footprint associated with their use of the digital service. The user will be able to access information detailing the parameters of this "energy sobriety" mode and the associated environmental gains. 
      
      Document the actions implemented in the Ecodesign declaration of conformity, in particular the environmental information provided to users and the configuration of the "energy sobriety" mode, including the associated environmental gains.

      **Support des formats d’image selon les navigateurs web :**

      Une [étude de Greenspector](https://greenspector.com/fr/quel-format-dimage-choisir-pour-reduire-sa-consommation-denergie-et-son-impact-environnemental/), réalisée par Olivier Philippot en 2022, montre que la consommation électrique d’un smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S10 sous Android 10 avec une connexion Wi-Fi) est légèrement plus faible en présence d’image WebP ou AVIF, comparé à la compression JPEG.

      **WebP** est un format d'image matricielle développé et mis à disposition du public par Google en 2010 (2012 pour la compression sans perte de qualité). Aujourd’hui WebP est supporté par l’ensemble des navigateurs web et procurerait de 30 % à 80 % de réduction d'espace face à JPEG et PNG, sans dégrader la qualité.

      **AVIF** est un format d’image plus récent et plus efficace en termes de compression que WebP. AVIF se montre également plus économe en énergie que les formats précédents. Développé par le consortium Alliance for Open Media et finalisé en 2019, AVIF est supporté par l’ensemble des navigateurs web, mais compte tenu du temps pour que les utilisateurs réalisent les mises à jour, il n’est pas encore pris en charge par l’ensemble du parc des versions installées.

      **JPEG XL** est un format d’image matricielle plus récent et plus efficace en termes de compression que WebP / AVIF en mode avec/sans perte. Contrairement à WebP ou AVIF, JPEG XL n’est pas, à date, supporté par l’ensemble des navigateurs web.

      **SVG** est un format d’image vectoriel. La principale problématique provient de la façon de gérer les caractères dans les images SVG. Afin de permettre une compatibilité avec toutes les plateformes, il est préférable de convertir le texte en chemin vectoriel, afin de ne pas faire appel à des polices de caractères externes.

      Voici un tableau détaillant le support des formats d’image par navigateur, afin d’aider au choix du format à utiliser :

      Lors de la génération d’une image matricielle, en mode compression avec perte (c’est le mode de compression du JPEG), la compression à une qualité de 70% (JPEG), 72% (WebP) ou 56% (AVIF) peut être visuellement acceptable.

    objectif: |-
      Il arrive parfois que le contenu vidéo soit en haute définition alors que le contexte de visualisation n’en a pas besoin, ce qui a pour effet d’augmenter la consommation énergétique du terminal et la quantité de données transférées. Il est donc important d’ajuster précisément la définition vidéo par défaut au terminal utilisé et de donner de l’autonomie à l’utilisateur pour limiter les impacts environnementaux de ses usages en lui permettant de réduire ou d’augmenter la définition de la vidéo.

      L’objectif est ainsi de limiter les ressources informatiques et la consommation énergétique associée au visionnage de vidéos. Le critère est applicable aux vidéos diffusées en unicast, terme définissant une connexion réseau point à point, c'est-à-dire d'un hôte vers un (seul) autre hôte. C’est le mode de diffusion utilisé sur internet.

      Le critère n’est pas applicable au multicast/broadcast, puisque cela engendrerait une multiplication des flux contreproductive. Les diffusions de type multicast/broadcast concernent uniquement certains modes de diffusion TV (par exemple : TNT, certains flux transmis via le décodeur TV) et désigne une forme de diffusion d’un émetteur unique vers un groupe de récepteurs.

      - Etablir une définition par défaut ne doit pas dépasser les définitions du mode « qualité standard » défini ci-après.
      - Définir un mode « sobriété énergétique » (qui peut également être appelé « économie de données ») doit être facilement accessible sur l’interface. Son activation baisse la définition, de manière à ne pas dépasser les définitions du mode « sobriété énergétique » défini ci-après. Le service numérique doit être en mesure de mémoriser ce choix et de l’appliquer pour les prochaines lectures de vidéos.
      - De manière optionnelle, proposer un mode « haute qualité » =, utilisé uniquement sur demande de l’utilisateur (en l’informant le cas échéant que le recours à ce mode « haute qualité » peut avoir un impact sur la quantité de données transmises et la consommation énergétique).

      **Les différentes définitions à utiliser lors de l’encodage vidéo**

      Plusieurs leviers peuvent être déployés pour optimiser l’impact environnemental de la vidéo en agissant en particulier sur la définition et l’encodage de la vidéo.

      Pour proposer différentes définitions de vidéos au terminal, il faut avoir au préalable encodé chaque vidéo dans différentes définitions.

      L’encodage vidéo entraîne deux types de coûts environnementaux :

        -  Coût processeur pour l’encodage ;
        -  Coût de stockage.

      Un service écoconçu doit limiter le nombre d’encodages. Certains services vidéo proposent plus de 20 encodages d’une même vidéo, afin de couvrir plusieurs codecs et définitions vidéo.

      Exemple d’une solution sobre, avec seulement trois définitions :

        -  Encodage 480p : pour le mode « sobriété énergétique » ;
        -  Encodage 720p : pour le mode « qualité standard » ;

    critere: Video Compression Efficiency
    thematique: Video Traffic and Resource Optimization
    objectif: |
      Most internet traffic is tied to watching videos (video accounted for nearly 66% of internet traffic in 2023 according to Sandvine's The Global Internet Phenomena Report). Relaying data traffic relies on infrastructures as well as the use of equipment and devices whose environmental footprint needs to be minimised. The use of an efficient video codec (currently: AV1, VP9 and HEVC) can significantly reduce the bandwidth used.

      In addition, the way a device decodes the video codec has a direct impact on its power consumption. If the codec is not hardware-accelerated by the graphics processing unit (GPU), video playback will be possible, but only via the microprocessor (CPU). In which case the device will consume more energy, which will reduce the autonomy of a battery-based device and possibly its lifespan.

      The goal is therefore to optimise the size of the streams downloaded by users and the resources mobilised through the use of a codec and efficient encoding.

    miseEnOeuvre: |
      Videos are offered with at least one high-performance codec (currently: AV1, VP9 and HEVC) taking into account the codec's compression efficiency and its hardware acceleration in 720p and higher resolutions. H.264 can be offered as an add-on to the high-performance codec.

      To save bandwidth on scenes that are easy to encode, variable bitrate encoding should be preferred. In some cases, this encryption method may be associated with a cap on the maximum bitrate to ensure that more complex content remains playable with a low-speed internet connection.

      In addition, the video's encoding quality should be adapted to the user's needs. For example, using the lowest quality level without visually degrading the video in the context of use.

      The audio streams' encoding quality should be adapted to the user's needs: optimising speed (bitrate), (compression) ratio and sample rate within the format; adapted choice of channels numbers: stereo for music or mono for dialogue (see criterion 5.6. dedicated to audio).

    controle: |
      The criterion is validated if the service meets the following conditions:
      - Videos are encoded with a variable bitrate, regardless of the video codec used. In some cases, this encryption method may be associated with a cap on the maximum bitrate to ensure that more complex content remains playable with a low-speed internet connection
      - Videos available on the digital service have a resolution of less than 720p or are provided with an efficient video codec, AV1, VP9 or HEVC date (for videos encoded in 720p or higher). The H.264 codec can be used as a backup in case of incompatibility, as long as a higher performance codec is offered to compatible devices
      - The codec(s) used are hardware-accelerated by the majority of the playback devices
      - Document the video and audio codec(s) used for each video definition, the type of video encoding: fixed, variable, variable bitrate with maximum bitrate/presence of HDR and the type of audio encoding: bitrate, number of channels in the digital service's Ecodesign declaration of conformity

      Pour la mise à disposition de vidéos sur internet en 2024, quatre codecs vidéo récents sont principalement utilisés : H.264, HEVC (ou H.265), VP9 et AV1.

      H.264 AVC : le codec vidéo le plus utilisé

      H.264, également appelé MPEG-4 AVC, est utilisé par la quasi-totalité des plateformes proposant de la vidéo sur internet (certaines plateformes proposent leurs vidéos dans plusieurs codecs, mais H.264 est presque systématiquement proposé). Il semble consommer davantage de données que les codecs plus récents à ce jour.

      Le codec est bien supporté matériellement et logiciellement. Le codec vidéo H.264 est aussi supporté par l’ensemble des navigateurs web depuis 2015. Cependant les codecs vidéo développés plus récemment présentent des performances plus avancées en termes d’efficacité de compression.

      HEVC : le codec de la TNT UHD

      HEVC, également appelé H.265, a été spécifié en 2013. HEVC permet un gain en compression sur H.264. Il s’agit d’un codec dont les droits d’utilisation sont payants.

      Si HEVC est bien pris en charge dans l’écosystème Apple et sur les box TV, ce n’est pas le cas des navigateurs web, à l’exception de Safari.

      VP9 : le codec ouvert le plus répandu

      VP9 est un codec vidéo ouvert et sans redevance, développé par Google. VP9 permet, comme HEVC, un gain en compression sur H.264. Autre point qu’il partage avec HEVC : la très grande majorité des terminaux utilisés en France ont une accélération matérielle, permettant une faible consommation d’énergie sur le terminal lors de la lecture de vidéos ayant recours à ce codec.

      Le codec VP9 est supporté par tous les navigateurs web depuis 2018, sauf sur Safari sur iPhone et iPad où la version 17.4 de iOS / iPadOS est nécessaire (version proposée depuis avril 2024).

      AV1 : le codec le plus récent

      AV1 est le codec vidéo présent le plus récent, spécifié en 2018 par l’Alliance for Open Media. Il est ouvert et sans redevance. AV1 semble permettre un gain en compression sur VP9 ou HEVC et un débit divisé par deux par rapport à H.264, sans dégradation de la qualité.

      Néanmoins, l’accélération matérielle de ce codec vidéo est limitée à certains terminaux de dernière génération. Toutefois, le parc de terminaux avec un décodage matériel d’AV1 augmente rapidement.

      Pour les années 2024 à 2026, le codec VP9 semble l’un des meilleurs compromis en termes d’écoconception (au-delà de 2026, cela pourrait être AV1) :

          Performant : le taux de compression de VP9 semble sensiblement moindre que celui d’AV1, mais il permet aux vidéos d’avoir un gain moyen de 30 % de bande passante sur H.264.
          Faible consommation d’énergie : la prise en charge matérielle de la quasi-totalité des terminaux permet d’avoir une consommation d’énergie très faible. Sur un smartphone ne prenant pas en charge AV1, c’est le codec le plus économe en énergie.
          Pris en charge par tous les navigateurs récents.

    critere: Audio-Only Mode for Videos
    thematique: Video Traffic and Power Consumption Reduction
    objectif: |
      A significant part of video traffic on the internet is made up of videos that are listened to (source: study by Chris Priest, from the University of Bristol in the United Kingdom on the use of an audio-only button on the YouTube application from May 2019):

      - music videos playing in the background
      - filmed podcasts that are listened to and not watched
      - broadcasts listened to while doing something else (washing up, showering, etc.)

      The first goal is to reduce traffic by allowing the user to mute their video stream via an audio-only option; "0p" or "zero pixels" to reduce traffic generated by the video that is not being watched.
      The second goal is to reduce devices' power consumption by allowing them to enable a video's audio track when the screen is off.

    miseEnOeuvre: |
      Provide an option for the user to simply switch to audio-only mode on the video player (and if possible, switch back to video mode, if they want to watch the video again). In audio-only mode, the video stream is no longer downloaded by the video player, which confines itself to the audio stream.

      Automatically switch videos to audio-only when the digital service detects that the video is no longer being watch or when the user turns off their screen. For instance:
      - Use of digital service on smartphone/tablet/connected device (native application or via web browser): pressing the sleep button must switch the video to audio-only mode, to allow the user to continue listening to the video while drastically reducing power consumption, with the screen turned off and only the audio data being transferred
      - If the digital service is being accessed through’ a web browser, switching to a tab other than the video’s’ tab should trigger audio-only mode. When the user returns to the video’s tab, it can switch back to video mode

      In the case of a digital service that uses a video platform that does not offer audio-only mode, an alternative is to provide a link to the audio version below the video, to allow the user to choose their playback mode

    controle: |
      The criterion is validated if:
      - The service offers audio-only mode on videos, which can be enabled at the user's request and is activated when it can be detected that the video is not displayed on the device (e.g. switching tabs in a browser or applications on a device, closing screens, etc.). In the event that the service's videos are already hosted by a third-party service that does not offer this audio-only mode, it is possible to validate the criterion by offering an audio-only recording under each video (without preloading the associated video)
      - The location and operation of the "audio-only" mode are documented in the digital service's Ecodesign declaration of conformity

    critere: Audio Content Compression Optimization
    thematique: Audio File Size Reduction
    objectif: |
      Reduce the size of audio content uploaded by users and therefore the required IT resources.

    miseEnOeuvre: |
      To reduce the size of audio content, consider the following: use efficient audio codecs (currently: Opus, AAC, HE-AAC, HE-AAC v2, HD-AAC, Dolby E-AC-3 or Dolby AC-4), avoiding the largest formats. All web browsers support an audio-only stream (without accompanying video) with the Opus codec, in a WebM container, and with the AAC codec, in an MP4 container. Optimisation of bitrate, compression ratio, and sample rate within the format. Suitable choice: stereo for music or mono for dialogue. Avoid a megabytes to duration in minutes ratio greater than 1.

    controle: |
      The criterion is validated if the service meets the following conditions: the audio content available on the digital service is offered with an efficient audio codec, currently Opus, AAC, HE-AAC, HE-AAC v2, HD-AAC, Dolby E-AC-3 or Dolby AC-4 (an inefficient codec may be offered as a fallback, provided that a more efficient one is available to compatible devices). Document the audio codec(s) used, the type of audio encoding: bitrate, number of channels in the digital service's Ecodesign declaration of conformity.

    critere: Does the digital service use a file format adapted to each document’s content and context of use?
    thematique: Document Compression and Format Selection
    objectif: |
      Reduce the size of files uploaded by users.

    miseEnOeuvre: |
      Adjust document compression settings to generate smaller file sizes. Consider the specific needs of the content and context of use to determine the most appropriate file format. Example: use a vector image if it is more appropriate than a raster image (or bitmap images), which is made up of pixels. In particular, use a file format that is optimised for online viewing, when the document is intended to be viewed online.

    controle: |
      Assess the document's size based on its content. The criterion is validated if the documents used for the digital service's operation are compressed to reduce their size and adapt to the viewing and use context and to the content. The document compression strategy must be documented and auditable by a third party, for instance by being detailed in the digital service's Ecodesign declaration of conformity.

    thematique: Content Management and Data Lifecycle
    objectif: |
      Relieving databases and physical servers of useless data.
    miseEnOeuvre: |
      Define a strategy for archiving and deleting content that is obsolete, expired, outdated, or does not need to be kept by the digital service. This policy can be automated by setting an expiration date and an automatic archiving and/or purge process. In addition to automatic archiving mechanisms, there should also be manual deletion mechanisms for specific content that needs to be assessed by a human. This strategy is mandatory for the subset of personal data collected by the services, which requires the definition and communication of a retention period for personal data (GDPR Art.13-2).
    controle: |
      To validate this criterion, verify the existence of a clearly defined archiving and deletion policy, the existence of automatic mechanisms and manual processes for content that requires human intervention to process. This strategy can be monitored by regularly assessing the occupancy rate of databases and physical servers.

    critere: Digital Service Screen Data Limitation
    thematique: Frontend
    objectif: |
      Reduce or limit the downloaded data.

    miseEnOeuvre: |
      The term "screen" or display is used here to refer to "virtual screen" and not to physical one. If the digital service is a website, the screen refers to the page, for an API, the screen refers to the server's response. 
      
      Define and monitor indicators for: 
      * maximum data volume per screen, taking into account all downloaded assets (interface components, data, content, scripts, style sheets, etc.). For example, for a web page (with all resources loaded) that weighs 2 MB, the goal would be to go down to 1 MB. Depending on the context, this target can be much lower.
      * maximum client/server requests per screen, taking into account all downloaded resources (interface components, data, content, scripts, style sheets, etc.). For example, a good target for a website would be fewer than 30 requests per page instead of 100.

    controle: |
      In the Ecodesign declaration of conformity display: 
      - the defined and proportionate maximum data volume per screen, and comply with this limit. 
      - the maximum number of queries per defined screen. Specify whether the limits on the number of requests relates only to web page's loading or to its operation as well (e.g. web page with an input form; does the number of requests include field control requests?).

    critere: Does the digital service use caching mechanisms for all of the transferred content that it controls?
    thematique: Frontend
    objectif: |
      The aim is to reduce the amount of data traffic travelling over the network. Part of digital services' energy footprint of is tied to the volume of data exchanged over networks, especially when data is transmitted over radio networks (e.g. mobile networks). Reducing the volume of data exchanged on networks for a given application is therefore an important aspect of ecodesign. In most cases, this reduction can be done without degrading the user experience.

    miseEnOeuvre: |
      The caching strategy should be adapted to the application context, the type of content (images, CSS files, JavaScript, etc.) that are frequently transferred from the server to the client, and the usage scenario. Set up a caching mechanism on the user side, on the frontend (e.g. HTTP cache). "Offline mode" management can sometimes be highly relevant, sometimes not. 
      
      When the same piece of information is likely to be requested multiple times, use temporary local storage to avoid unnecessary network traffic. For example, it is possible to store often used data on the web browser, to limit exchanges with the server. 
      
      Check that none of the data intended to be exchanged is superfluous and that the information transmitted is not redundant.

      Criterion 6.2 deals with client-side cache. The server-side cache is addressed in criterion 7.1.
    controle: |
      To validate this criterion, a user-side caching mechanism is set up, when the solution is appropriate. In terms of testing methods, access repeatedly and check that the content is retrieved from the cache rather than the server. 
      
      Explain the frontend cache strategy in the service's Ecodesign declaration of conformity, including its optimisation with regard to the type of content, the application context and the usage scenarios.

    critere: Has the digital service implemented compression techniques for the transferred resources that it controls?
    thematique: Frontend
    objectif: |
      Reduce the amount of resources transferred over the network thanks to data compression.

    miseEnOeuvre: |
      Set up the compression, minification of script files. Be mindful, however, of not generating resource consumption if computing power is needed to "decompress" the files: systematic compression such as ".tgz" for small files can be counterproductive. This criterion only applies to text files (e.g. HTML, CSS, JavaScript).

      Implement end-to-end compression. Use flow compression mechanisms to minimise the volume of traffic exchanged. Promote, where possible, the most efficient compression mechanism.

      For example, several compression protocols exist for HTTP, such as Brotli and GZIP.

      This is not to be confused with criterion 5.2 on image compression (which does not address compression during transfer).

    controle: |
      The criterion is validated if the numeric service queries use a data compression mechanism at the frontend. For HTTP and HTML compression, the Brotli or GZIP compression mechanisms are recommended.
    Source: |-
      **How to enable Brotli?**
      
      This module is built into most browsers by default.
      
      More generally, the three major web servers today – Apache, Nginx and Microsoft IIS – all have an option to enable Brotli:
      * Apache: "mod brotli” allows you to add Brotli support;
      * Nginx: "ngx_brotli”;
      * Microsoft IIS: "IIS Brotli" extension.

      Some CDN providers also provide the option to enable Brotli.

    critere: Image Dimension Optimization
    thematique: Frontend
    objectif: |
      Reduce or limit the amount of data downloaded by offering server-side resizing for images whose definition is too high. The aim is also to minimise the device's power consumption.

    miseEnOeuvre: |
      Raster images (or bitmap images) on a digital service are either displayed in their original size or offered in multiple resolutions, to avoid loading an image with a significantly higher resolution than the display context used by the customer.

      When raster images are added to the digital service, display dimensions are required or resizing is done on the server side, when the file is added by a contributor.

    controle: |
      To be compliant, images on the digital service must fall into one of the following three categories:
      - be vector images;
      - be raster images, displayed in their original size (no resizing);
      - in the case of fluid images (the image occupies a percentage of the width of the parent), several image variants exist with different resolutions, and the best one is on the screen, according to the display context.

      If the digital service allows a contributor to add images, server-side resizing must be done for images that exceed a certain size (expressed in pixels or bytes) or image definition.

      It is often easier for the development team to load all the components, packaged in a compressed file regardless of the feature. As a result, the user loads components that may not necessarily be used. Using only what is actually necessary for the service's operation saves IT resources.

    miseEnOeuvre: |
      Only load resources and components when they are actually used. 
      
      Provide progressive loading mechanisms for graphics and media that require downloading – e.g.: streaming for video, loading only the images or assets displayed on the screen ("lazy loading") when the user reaches them by scrolling down the page.

Limit the activation of sensors to times when they are truly necessary for the proper functioning of the service or by activating a feature expressly requested by the user. The definition of "when they are truly needed" must be objectified for each use: the use of sensors must be minimal by default, but the user can also be offered a "degraded mode", to satisfy the desired essential purpose, optimising hardware resources and the battery in particular, without going as far as nominal or ideal operation.

    critere: Data and Document Retention Periods

      Data storage is neither unlimited nor free, it has an environmental impact and must be optimised. Some services process large amounts of data that are never accessed because the user has stopped using the product (but has not deleted their account, for instance) or because the data has been out of date for some time. Setting retention periods for personal data is also one of the GDPR obligations. 
      
      The goal is to relieve databases and physical servers of the burden of useless data.

    miseEnOeuvre: |
      Set expiration dates on data (files, database entries, etc.) to archive and/or delete them. Implement features that help users identify outdated data through flags and/or location suggestions where data can be deleted.

    critere: Does the digital service rely on a consensus mechanism that minimises its resource consumption?
    thematique: Backend
    objectif: |-
      The energy footprint of digital services based on public blockchain technology will depend mainly on the chosen consensus mechanism. Unlike private and consortium blockchains, public blockchains are open to any participant and must therefore rely on a particularly secure consensus mechanism. Proof-of-work is the consensus mechanism that consumes the most energy, as it relies on data mining. The goal is therefore to reduce the blockchain's environmental impact by avoiding any consensus algorithm based on data mining, and by choosing one that consumes less energy, and fewer resources in general.

    miseEnOeuvre: |-
      Take the energy consumption criterion into account when choosing a blockchain. Choose an alternative consensus mechanism to proof-of-work that does not rely on mining, and ensure that the consensus algorithm is low power consumption. For instance:
      - Proof of Stake
      - Delegated Proof of Stake
      - Proof of Authority

Depending on the service's features, choose a blockchain consensus algorithm that will minimise the required energy consumption. Verify that the blockchain's parameters minimise its environmental impact.

      If the service is based on a proof-of-work blockchain or a mining-based consensus algorithm that is generally associated with high energy and resource consumption, the criterion is not validated.

    critere: Hosting Provider Environmental Footprint Reduction Strategy
    thematique: Hosting
    objectif: |
      Data centres account for around 15% of ICT's carbon footprint in France, and their environmental footprint is not limited to GHG emissions (ADEME-Arcep study). When choosing a hosting solution, it is therefore important to take into account how the data centre is working to curtail its environmental footprint. This means opting for a hosting provider that monitors its environmental footprint and is taking proactive steps to reduce it.

    miseEnOeuvre: |
      Select a hosting provider that is transparent about its environmental footprint and has made commitments to reduce it. An LCA is recommended or, at very least, the publication of the following indicators: GHG emissions (market-based and location-based), energy consumption, water consumption, abiotic resource use (minerals/metals).

      The hosting provider must also have made commitments to minimise its environmental footprint, targeting at least the following indicators: GHG emissions (market-based and location-based), energy consumption, water consumption, abiotic resource use (minerals/metals). Existing frameworks or standards must be used to verify the hosting providers' environmental commitments, and specifically:
      - European Code of Conduct for Energy Efficiency in Data Centres, established by the European Commission
      - ISO International Environmental management standards: ISO 14001…
      - environmental auditor certification:ISO 14001LEED , BREAM, HQE…
      - environmental impact assessment and communication via recognised standards (e.g.: Product Category Rule (PCR), Carbon audit/GHG Protocol, ISO14063, ITU standards, Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP), Science Based Targets (SBTi)…), resource pooling
      - type of cooling that minimises the consumption of refrigerants, water and energy in the technical environment
      - waste heat recovery mechanism
      - implementation of efforts to improve hosting's energy performance via ISO 50001 certification
      - environmental impact analysis of the move to the cloud for players with on-premise servers or calculators supplied by providers prior to migration
      - data centre construction policy and minimising soil artificialisation
      - charter, certified CSR policy, etc.

      Remain vigilant to greenwashing when it comes to communications regarding carbon neutrality, an internal charter, policy or roadmap, without the ability to verify implementation or without an independent third party certifying the implementation.

    controle: |
      Choose a hosting provider that is transparent about its environmental footprint and its commitments to the environment. To verify the veracity of the information provided by data centres, it is advisable to request environmental performance certificates from the hosting companies, as well as the methodologies used based on recognised norms and standards (ISO, etc.).

      Verify or request commitments from the hosting provider to reduce its environmental footprint – at least concerning the following indicators: GHG emissions (market-based and location-based), energy consumption, water consumption, abiotic resource use (minerals/metals). Ensure the ratification of the Data Centre Code of Conduct by the hosting provider (refer, if possible, to the European Commission's methodology set out in the Taxonomy Climate Delegated Act which assesses data centre compliance with this Code of Conduct) and associated actions.

      Document the hosting provider's environmental footprint and the implementation of its commitments in the service's Ecodesign declaration of conformity.

Communication on the lifespan of equipment (servers, network switches, firewalls, routers, etc.) and on the management of the life cycle of its fleet.

The plan should cover information on the lifespan of the equipment, the sustainable purchasing policy and the actions put in place to minimise the environmental footprint of the life cycle of the equipment used by the hosting provider.

    critere: Does the digital service use a hosting provider with a low PUE (Power Usage Effectiveness)?
    thematique: Hosting
    objectif: |
      Know the PUE of one's hosting provider. Reduce the energy consumption required for the proper operation and cooling of the servers required for hosting. Data centres are encouraged to reduce and limit the energy required to keep servers running and cool.

    miseEnOeuvre: |
      It is recommended that the data centre's PUE be a factor when choosing the hosting solution. For hosting providers that have been in operation for more than two years, PUE must be measured based on their "real-world" value and not "by design," and using a methodology based on internationally recognised norms and standards (e.g. ISO standards). 
      
      Select a hosting provider that indicates its PUE and the strategy implemented to reduce it. The information provided on this indicator is accompanied by information on the methodology used to measure it, based on internationally recognised standards (by ex. ISO/IEC 30134) and in particular on the type of PUE that is measured (type 1, 2 or 3).

      Power usage effectiveness is an energy efficiency indicator that consists of a ratio between the total energy consumed by the entire operations centre (including cooling, air treatment, inverters, etc.) and the part that is actually consumed by the IT systems the centre operates (servers, storage, network). A PUE of close to 1 indicates excellent data centre power performance. Typically, hyperscalers have a PUE of 1.1 compared to 2 for older data centres. Improving this indicator can, however, degrade other indicators, without reducing either the overall impact or energy consumption, hence the benefit of monitoring several indicators (energy consumption, water consumption, equipment management policy, etc. see criterion 8.1.). 
      
      **N.B.:** Newer data centres do not yet have sufficient fill capacity for the actual PUE to be a useful indicator. For a centre with less than two years of operation, PUE by design is a better indicator to refer to, but only to avoid the risk of obsolescence.

    controle: |
      What is the digital service host's PUE? 
      
      Check that the digital service's hosting provider has published this performance indicator. 
      
      To validate the criterion, choose a hosting provider with a "real-world" PUE of less than 1.5 (or a PUE by design less than or equal to 1.3 if the host's facilities have been in operation for less than two years – in which case the criterion will have to be reassessed after the two-year period).

      If possible, provide a link to or proof of the hosting provider’s PUE in the service’s Ecodesign declaration of conformity.

    critere: "Does the digital service use a hosting provider with a low WUE (Water Usage Effectiveness)?"
    thematique: Hosting
    objectif: |-
     Know the hosting company’s WUE, an indicator that is often not taken into account. Reduce or limit the water consumption required to cool servers. Avoid water stress (i.e. shortage of drinking water). Local water stress can also be taken into account: a high WUE in a non-water-stressed area will be less problematic.
    miseEnOeuvre: |-
      Select a hosting provider that indicates its WUE, and the methodology used to measure it, based on internationally recognised standards (e.g. ISO/IEC 30134). This metric is the ratio between the amount of water consumed and the total energy used by the data centre. It is measured in L/kWh. For hosting providers that have been in operation for more than two years, the WUE should be measured, if possible, based on their "real-world" value and not "by design," and using a methodology based on internationally recognised norms and standards (e.g. ISO standards).
      
      **NB:** There is currently little or no open data on the subject of local water stress. As with the PUE, improving this indicator can degrade other indicators, without reducing either the overall environmental impact or energy consumption, hence the value of monitoring several indicators (energy consumption, water consumption, hardware management policy, etc.).
    controle: |-
      The criterion is validated if the digital service’s host demonstrates a strategy for minimising its water consumption by following the relevant indicators, in particular its WUE. Set a target WUE* of less than or equal to 0.4L/kWh (calculate the real world WUE if possible and, if not, consider the WUE by design, especially for data centres that have been in operation for less than two years – the criterion must therefore be reassessed this two-year period). 
      
      The calculation methodology and the type of WUE – real world or by design – must be specified with the reported value. If possible, provide a link to or proof of the hosting provider’s WUE in the service’s Ecodesign declaration of conformity.

      /* Water consumption is still relatively poorly documented at the time of writing this policy framework. This means that technical specificities and possible regulatory changes that are underway will need to be taken into account when assessing this criterion, in particular with regard to the quantified target WUE.

    critere: Does the digital service use a hosting provider whose energy source is documented, and which is primarily renewable?
    thematique: Hosting
    objectif: |
      The objective of this criterion is to promote transparency on the origin of data centres' electricity consumption and to work towards the energy transition, in particular the development of renewable energies.

    miseEnOeuvre: |
      Ask the hosting provider about its policy in terms of electricity purchase. PPAs (Power Purchase Agreements) for long-term renewable energy contracts are considered to be of higher quality than certificates of origin for electricity.
      
      See the report Development of the EU Green Public Procurement (GPP) criteria for data centres, server rooms and cloud services. The annual quantity of energy contracted will thus have to be reported, including: via PPA on the French grid but off-site, via self-consumption therefore on site (potentially by PPA or full support of capital costs and others) and via guarantees of origin. For guarantees of renewable origin, additionality must be proven.
      
      Secondarily, a standardised performance indicator can be monitored: the REF, the Renewable Energy Factor. The share of low-carbon electricity is also relevant data for understanding the environmental footprint of the hosting provider’s energy mix.
    controle: |
      Ensure the hosting provider’s transparency in terms of renewable energy. 
      
      Ask for proof of the origin of the electricity consumed by the host (PPA – Power Purchase Agreement as a first choice, otherwise Certificate of Origin of the electricity). 
      
      The criterion is validated if the digital service’s host is transparent about its energy mix and documents a policy of majority use of renewable energies, having an actual impact in reducing demand for fossil energy. In addition to the REF indicator, the hosting provider must provide the annual quantity of energy contracted as described in the "implementation" section to document its renewable energy policy.

      The goal is, first, to prefer hosting in a country where carbon intensity is low and, second, in a region where the majority of customers are located, to reduce the distance travelled by the data and thereby reduce the network infrastructure mobilised and its environmental footprint.

    miseEnOeuvre: |
      Choose a hosting provider whose servers are located in a country with low-carbon electricity (source: Electricity Maps). Whenever possible, it is also advisable to prioritise a hosting provider located close to identified users and businesses (this does not mean adopting Edge Computing technologies but rather choosing a data centre close to the service's users).

      Encourage initiatives to reduce or recover the energy produced, for instance, to heat buildings in winter.
      Refer to the ADEME definition of waste heat.

    miseEnOeuvre: |
      Choose a hosting provider or request commitments from a hosting provider to recover and reuse the waste heat generated (e.g., to directly heat offices or other nearby facilities) or to alternative mechanisms to manage server temperatures and minimise the hosting service's environmental footprint.

    controle: |
      The criterion is validated if the hosting provider has implemented initiatives to ensure the recovery and reuse of the waste heat generated by its installations, and that these are documented in the digital service's Ecodesign declaration of conformity. The overall environmental performance of the reuse of the heat produced must be positive, factoring in the initial investment to build or adapt the installations to validate the criterion.
      
      Alternatively, the criterion can be validated if the data centre used for the service has a "real world" PUE of less than 1.3 (or a PUE by design of less than or equal to 1.2 if the host's facilities have been in operation for less than two years – the criterion must therefore be reassessed once the facilities have been operating for more than two years). While energy-efficient, a data centre with a low PUE can make this waste heat reuse impossible or complicated.

      This means tailoring the service level to actual need. The higher the required availability rate, the more financially and environmentally costly the required infrastructure will be.

    miseEnOeuvre: |
      Do not systematically duplicate all data. Identify the data that need to be duplicated (e.g., critical or high-demand data). 
      A balance must be found between security (to avoid data loss) and dissemination (having too much of it everywhere).
      
      Consider the relevance of the service's redundancy, to achieve the right balance. Is it critical if one of the service's features is not available for a brief period?
      
      Redundancy strategies include:
      - Backup & Restore is the cheapest solution, perfectly suited to applications that have an RTO (Recovery Time Objective) or RPO (Recovery Point Objective) of a few hours;
      - Pilot Light, a "mirrored"/duplicated database but with VMs turned off, for instance. A slightly more expensive process than Backup & Restore, it works for most applications that do not have extreme SLA (Service Level Agreement) requirements (less than one hour);
      - Warm Standby, when VMs are already running but with limited scalability, almost in real time but potentially in slightly degraded quality if there is an incident;
      - Multi-site hot standby: total resiliency for real-time SLAs. No loss of service is tolerated, but it necessarily comes at a cost.

      Plan energy-intensive asynchronous computing and data transfers (backup, updates, training, etc.) outside of daily power consumption peaks, for consumer algorithms and processing that can be time shifted.
      
      Adjust the timing of asynchronous computing and data transfers to avoid times when servers and networks are the most stressed, to avoid having to purchase new equipment to handle spikes. Prefer data transfers from a mobile device when it is connected to the wireline network (which is less sensitive to traffic than mobile networks in terms of resources and energy consumption).

    miseEnOeuvre: |
      1. Energy: avoid planning asynchronous computing or data transfers during daily peak power consumption times (when electricity production is the most carbon-intensive) for operations that can be time shifted (e.g. use the Ecowatt API developed by RTE and ADEME).
      
      2. Infrastructure: delay important calculations and updates when computing resource availability is low (to avoid having to purchase new equipment).
      
      3. Network: time shift heavy operations, by limiting the use of the internet between 7:00 p.m. and 11:00 p.m. For example, if a large update is ready to go live at 6:00 p.m., declare it ready to go live at 11:00 p.m.
      
      When the mobile service is used on a mobile device that can connect to both a mobile and a wireline network, postpone non-urgent data transfers (e.g. non-critical updates, backups, statistical feedback) until the device is connected to the wireline network.
    controle: |-

    thematique: Algorithmics
    objectif: |
      The training (aka learning) phase is based on a digital infrastructure which, in some cases, may require the use of a large volume of data and calculations. Widely used in the field of artificial intelligence, the training phase can consume a great deal of energy and resources. The goal is therefore to reduce the environmental footprint of the learning phase by choosing a method that is adapted and proportionate to the digital service's characteristics.
      
      It will therefore be necessary to question the need to include a training phase in the digital service. Do not include a training phase if it is not required to improve the service.

    miseEnOeuvre: |
      Identify target users and their needs (see implementation of criterion 1.2) with regard to the digital service. List the service's features that are essential to meeting these needs and question whether it is necessary to include a training phase.
      
      Regularly question the hoped-for added value from the training phase: does the addition of a training phase significantly improve the digital service's ability to meet the needs of its targets? Is the improvement actually noticeable and useful to the user?

    controle: |
      Do not include a training phase until there is proven need for one, and prefer classic research methods or existing, already trained solutions. If necessary, target audiences and associated needs: make available the reference documents that draw on studies, interviews, research, and personas that have enabled the definition of target users and their needs.
      
      Substantiate the link with the service's features and the reasons for the need (if applicable) to include a training phase in the digital service in the Ecodesign declaration of conformity. If the needs are clearly established, define a sufficient level of satisfaction and choose a proportionate training frequency.
      
      Substantiate the addition of a training phase in the service in terms of the added value for the service's users.
      
      The criterion is validated if the service does not include unwarranted learning and therefore follows, in the event of the implementation, demonstrating the utility of the training phase and that it is proportionate to the needs of these targets and the features concerned.

    thematique: Algorithmics
    objectif: | 
      The goal is to question the data collected and to minimise the environmental impacts associated with their collection and processing for the training phase, by favouring existing data and by limiting the collection of new data. As highlighted in the CNIL report "Data, Footprint and Liberties" (2023), certain imperatives of respect for private life and eco-design objectives are aligned. This criterion is relevant for the learning phase, which is most often characterised by a high obsolescence of the databases used.

    miseEnOeuvre: |
      Ensure that existing data (including royalty-free data) is reused whenever possible to limit the collection of new data and the incremental computing power required for data analysis. Compare the environmental footprint created by the acquisition of new storage equipment versus that of systematically downloading data when necessary.
      
      Be sure to limit the capture of new data for the learning phase.
      
      Apply criteria 7.1 and 7.2 for setting up a caching, compression, and management policy for data in the training phase.

    controle: |
      Use existing databases to train the digital service. Verify that data collection is minimised and list the methods implemented in the digital service's Ecodesign declaration of conformity.
      
      Verify the implementation of criteria 7.1 and 7.2 for the implementation of a cache, compression and management policy for the data used for the training phase.
      
      The criterion is validated if the service uses existing databases and applies criteria 7.1. and 7.2 for the learning phase, as soon as possible, while documenting its data management and including its sustainability issues, in its Ecodesign declaration of conformity.

    critere: Does the digital service optimise model updates and retraining according to its own needs and those of target users?
    thematique: Algorithmics
    objectif: |
      The goal is to examine the frequency of updates and retraining of the models underlying the digital service with respect to the service’s actual needs (in terms of quality and verifiability) and the needs of its target users. Each update and new training consumes resources and generates greenhouse gas emissions.. 
    miseEnOeuvre: |
      Establish the parameters for triggering model retraining at the service design stage. These parameters will have to take into account the actual needs of the service and the users, particularly in terms of quality, reliability and verifiability. Analyse digital service usage data to continuously adjust model update needs.
      Take into account user feedback, technological developments and changes in the competitive environment to determine the optimal frequency for updates and retraining. Minimise the retraining of the service's algorithmic models as much as possible.

    controle: |
      Set the conditions for triggering the retraining or updating of the service's algorithmic models based on the actual needs of the service and its users, and possible legal constraints. Minimise the frequency of these operations as part of a sustainability strategy.
      Document these parameters and the choices made in the service's Ecodesign declaration of conformity, substantiating the consideration of ecodesign principles. The criterion is validated if it is demonstrated that the frequency of retraining is proportionate to the needs of the service and its target users, and is minimised as much as possible by the ongoing monitoring of indicators (performance, satisfaction and resource consumption).

    critere: Does the digital service use compression techniques for the models used during the training phase?
    thematique: Algorithmics
    objectif: |
      Compress artificial intelligence models (reduce model complexity) to reduce environmental impact.

    miseEnOeuvre: |
      Compress models using the following methods:
      - sparsification
      - pruning
      - unification
      - local scaling (to limit the impact of quantification)
      - batch norm folding (reduce the redundancy of certain parameters)
      - quantisation
      - distillation
      - ...

    controle: |
      The criterion is validated if the digital service justifies the implementation of model compression methods, indicating the realised gains in the digital service's Ecodesign declaration of conformity.

    critere: Does the digital service use an inference strategy that is optimised in terms of resource consumption and target users?
    thematique: Algorithmics
    objectif: |
      Reduce the environmental footprint of algorithmic models used in artificial intelligence by optimising the resource requirements of their inference phase. This is particularly important for generative AI. While the training phase has long been perceived as the most energy-intensive, the development of generative AI tends to increase the share of energy consumption in the inference phase, due to the number of user requests for services that are massively consumed by the general public. Inference phase optimisation is vital to achieving more frugal AI models.

    miseEnOeuvre: |
      Define an inference strategy that minimises the need for resources, and matches target users' needs. Set up indicators to monitor energy consumption and the need for computing resources required for the inference phase. Analyse these metrics in relation to user satisfaction. Set targets for minimising resource consumption, taking into account the ratio of resources consumed to user satisfaction. Ensure that the inference phase optimises the number of user requests.
      
      Use efficient CPUs, GPUs, or TPUs, whose geographical location is consistent with their operation and minimises their environmental footprint (especially, in a country with the lowest possible carbon intensity).

    controle: |
      The service's inference strategy is tailored to user targets by minimising the resources required to operate the service and unnecessary queries. Indicators for monitoring resource consumption and user satisfaction are set up to adjust the inference phase, with the goal of having a frugal model underlying the service.
      
      The criterion is validated if the digital service demonstrates the implementation of ecodesign principles in its inference phase, tailored to users' needs, in its Ecodesign declaration of conformity.
